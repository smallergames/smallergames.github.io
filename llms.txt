# Smaller Games

> making and publishing smaller video and table top games.

## Pages

- [Home](https://smallergames.com/): Landing page — making a smaller game with rats, goblins, and other horrifying monsters. Links to dice.
- [One](https://smallergames.com/one): "Dice Fidget" - a dice-based physics fidget. Roll polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100), build up energy, and earn loot cubes that drop with realistic physics.

## Technical Details

- Static site hosted on GitHub Pages
- No frameworks - pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Uses Rapier physics engine (WASM) for loot cube physics
- Accessibility-focused with ARIA labels and screen reader support
- Does not honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (animations are the functionality); shows a warning modal instead
