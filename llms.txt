## Pages

- [Home](https://smallergames.com/): Gallery landing page listing all available games and fidgets
- [One](https://smallergames.com/one): "Dice Fidget" - a dice-based physics fidget. Roll polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100), build up energy, and earn loot cubes that drop with realistic physics.
- [Nothing](https://smallergames.com/nothing): Placeholder page

## Technical Details

- Static site hosted on GitHub Pages
- No frameworks - pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Uses Rapier physics engine (WASM) for loot cube physics
- Accessibility-focused with ARIA labels and screen reader support
- Does not honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (animations are the functionality); shows a warning modal instead
